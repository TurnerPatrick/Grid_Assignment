            <p>The Chicago Bulls have found their replacement for Jim Boylen, as the team has hired Billy Donovan as their next head coach.

                Donovan, who was previously the head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder, will now take over a Bulls team that has seen massive turnover in its front office and coaching staff in recent months.
                
                The story was reported by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, and was later confirmed by the Bulls.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Billy Donovan has agreed to a deal to become the next coach of the Chicago Bulls, sources tell ESPN.</p> Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn)

                “We are very pleased to welcome Billy and his family to the Chicago Bulls,” Bulls VP of Basketball Operations Arturas Karnisovas said in a statement. “The success that he has sustained over the course of his coaching career puts him on a different level. We feel his ability to help his players reach their potential, both individually and collectively, will mesh well with our roster.”

                Karnisovas, who replaced John Paxson in the executive VP role, has been busy this offseason, bringing in Marc Eversley to serve as the team's general manager, and has now replaced Boylen with Donovan.

            <h2>Training Camp "Bubble"<br><img id="Bulls_Pic" src="img/Bulls_Pic.jpg"></h2>
            <p>It’s been quite a while, six months in fact, since the Chicago Bulls have had team workouts or any sort of group activities. That’s all about to change with the beginning of voluntary workouts starting at the Advocate Center as per the announcement last week. The Bulls and the rest of the teams not invited to the NBA bubble in Orlando are hosting these events in their own respective cities. The team has been getting daily testing for COVID-19 throughout the week and will be staying at hotel, going back and forth between there and the Advocate Center. Ryan Arcidiacano and Denzel Valentine both gave tours of their rooms via the official Bulls Twitter account.</p><hr>
            <p>K.C. Johnson of NBC Sports Chicago reported last week that numerous players were expected to attend these workouts. The Bulls also tweeted out photos of the players arriving to the hotel which showed Zach LaVine, Daniel Gafford, Coby White, and Denzel Valentine there. Otto Porter Jr. is there as well as he posted the gear given by the team on his Instagram story.
